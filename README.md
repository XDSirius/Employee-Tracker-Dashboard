# Employee-Tracker-Dashboard
This ETD (Employee Tracker Dashboard) was created to have the ability to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a company so that management and business owners are able to organize and plan accordingly. This was done through the use of MYSQL2 and the Inquirer package.
